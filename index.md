Maintaining this project without much of contributions was really hard!

Getting true information and reliable content was also a challenge.

Therefore, I've decided to shut down this project.

In case you want to get in touch with me for future collaboration, please find the contact details below.

I hope that my efforts were helpful to keep you informed.

Stay Home,Stay Safe, Stay Calm, Be Informed.
